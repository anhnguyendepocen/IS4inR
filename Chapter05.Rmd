## Introduction and background 

This document is intended to help describe how to undertake analyses introduced 
as examples in the Fourth Edition of \emph{Intro Stats} (2013) by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock.
More information about the book can be found at http://wps.aw.com/aw_deveaux_stats_series.  This
file as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4.

This work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).

## Chapter 5: The Standard Deviation as a Ruler and the Normal Model

### Section 5.1: Standardizing with Z-Scores

From page 111

```{r}
library(mosaic); library(readr)
options(na.rm=TRUE)
options(digits=3)
(6.63-6.11)/0.238  # Dobrynska's jump was 2.18 SD's greater than the mean
```

```{r}
Heptathlon <- 
read_delim("http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4/data/Womens_Heptathlon_2012.txt",
  delim="\t")
nrow(Heptathlon)  
filter(Heptathlon, LJ >= max(LJ, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% data.frame()
favstats(~ LJ, data=Heptathlon)
(6.54 - mean(~ LJ, data=Heptathlon))/sd(~ LJ, data=Heptathlon)
```

### Section 5.2: Shifting and Scaling

### Section 5.3: Normal Models

The 68-95-99.7 rule

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
xpnorm(c(-3, -1.96, -1, 1, 1.96, 3), mean=0, sd=1, verbose=FALSE)
xpnorm(c(-3, -1.96, 1.96, 3), mean=0, sd=1, verbose=FALSE)
xpnorm(c(-3, 3), mean=0, sd=1, verbose=FALSE)
```

Step-by-step (page 120)

```{r}
xpnorm(600, mean=500, sd=100)
```

### Section 5.4: Finding normal percentiles

as on page 121

```{r}
xpnorm(680, mean=500, sd=100)
qnorm(0.964, mean=500, sd=100)   # inverse of pnorm()
qnorm(0.964, mean=0, sd=1)   # what is the z-score?
```

or on page 122

```{r}
xpnorm(450, mean=500, sd=100)
```

and page 123

```{r}
qnorm(.9, mean=500, sd=100)
qnorm(.9, mean=0, sd=1)   # or as a Z-score
```

### Section 5.5: Normal Probability Plots

See Figure 5.8 on page 127

```{r}
Nissan <- 
read_delim("http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4/data/Nissan.txt",
  delim="\t")
histogram(~ mpg, width=1, center=0.5, data=Nissan)
qqmath(~ mpg, data=Nissan)
```
